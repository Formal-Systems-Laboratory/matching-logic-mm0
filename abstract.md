This artifact includes the software used for generating proofs of equivalence
between and totality of regular expressions. It also includes testing
infrastructure for checking these proofs with Metamath Zero.

The benchmarks displayed in the paper are collected by running the `./test`
script. These may then be displayed in (pandoc) markdown using the
`./benchmark-aggregator.py` script.
